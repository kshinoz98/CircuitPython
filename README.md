# Servo with Metro
Using PWMio I connected an object to the 3 pin. What that means, I have no clue, but thats how it works. From there, it's fairly simple to just use the adafruit motor library. Using .Servo() I moved it back and forth. If I could do this assignment again, I probably would have just googled it a lot earlier and then I wouldn't have spent so much time trying to figure out the code.
# Rainbow Neopixel with Ultrasonic Sensor
Using a few different libraries I connected to the ultrasonic sensor, and managed to get a running distance. However, that was only the easiest part. Finding the right bounds and ways to shade from red to blue and blue to green took quite a while, as there are a lot of way which have varying levels of workingness. However, the way that I finally went with seemed to have work the best. By defining ranges, I made the light shade correctly.
